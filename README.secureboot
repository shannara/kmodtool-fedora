Secure boot is a setup using UEFI firmware to check cryptographic signatures
on the bootloader and associated OS kernel to ensure they have not been
tampered with or bypassed in the boot process.

This verification can be extended of Kernel and its modules.
It's default case in Fedora with UEFI and Secure Boot enable.

Fedora Project have signed kernel and also main modules with Fedora Key,
but 3rd party modules as NVIDIA, VirtualBox, etc.. need signed to load.

Kmodtool provide enroll process to sign third modules with own keypair.

You can also create own certificate and keypair with `kmodtoolgenca` command.
Before execute `kmodtoolgenca`:
- we suggest to tweak /etc/kmodtool/cacert.config with your own information
for certificate.
- set SIGNMOD to "enabled" in /etc/kmodtool/sign-keypair.conf

Now you need to enroll this key in MOK, this process describe below.
- Ask MOK to enroll new keypair with certificate with
`mokutil --import /etc/kmodtool/keys/public_key.der`
- MOK ask to generate password for enroll key.
- Reboot system needed for MOK import new enroll key.
- On next boot MOK Management was launched, you need to choose "Enroll MOK"
- Choose "Continue" to enroll Key or "View key 0" to show key was enrolled
- Confirm enrollment with select "Yes"
- You will be invited for enter password "WARN keyboard is mapped as QWERTY !!"
- The new key is enrolled, and system ask to reboot

You can confirm enrollment of key with execute :
 `mokutil --list-enrolled |grep Issuer`
